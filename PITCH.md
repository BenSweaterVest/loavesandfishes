# LOAVES AND FISHES
## Project Pitch Document

*"What if the greatest story ever told... was also the greatest game ever played?"*

---

## THE ELEVATOR PITCH

**Loaves and Fishes** is a lighthearted Biblical JRPG where you play as Jesus recruiting the 12 apostles, collecting blessed fish with elemental powers, and battling your way from Nazareth to Jerusalem. Think classic monster-collection RPGs meets Sunday School—respectful, punny, and surprisingly deep.

**Status**: Playable alpha (75% complete)
**Platform**: Text-based Python (migrating to graphics)
**Target Audience**: 25-40 year olds who grew up on 90s JRPGs
**Tone**: Soft parody—like LEGO games, poking fun without mocking

---

## WHY THIS GAME?

### The Gap in the Market

There are thousands of fantasy RPGs about made-up religions and gods. There are Christian games that are... let's be honest, usually preachy and not very fun. But there's a massive gap:

**Where's the FUN Biblical game that people actually WANT to play?**

### Our Unique Angle

1. **Respectful but Fun**: We treat the Bible seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously
2. **Nostalgia Hook**: Appeals to people who grew up on classic JRPGs
3. **Educational**: You'll learn actual Biblical geography, parables, and stories
4. **Genuinely Good Gameplay**: This isn't a tract disguised as a game—it's a game that happens to be Biblical

### The Holy Mackerel Moment

When we tell people about "Holy Mackerel" as a playable fish, they laugh. Then they get it. Then they WANT to play it. That's the magic—it's funny, but it works.

---

## WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL?

### 1. The Fish

**21 unique fish species** with actual theological meaning:
- **Holy Mackerel**: The sacred fish of Galilee
- **Bass of Galilee**: Strong as Peter's faith
- **Carp Diem**: Seize the day!
- **Breadfish Divine**: Half bread, half fish, 100% miracle
- **Leviathan**: The chaos monster you can actually tame

Each fish has:
- Unique stats and movesets
- Elemental types (Holy, Water, Earth, Spirit, Dark)
- Lore tied to Biblical stories
- Evolution chains

### 2. The Apostles

**12 playable companions**, each with unique battle abilities:
- **Peter**: Rock Foundation (boosts party defense)
- **John**: Revelation Blast (massive Holy damage)
- **Matthew**: Tax Collection (steals money from enemies)
- **Thomas**: Doubting Strike (ignores defense)
- Even **Judas** (with a dangerous but powerful ability)

### 3. The World

**13 towns across ancient Israel**:
- Nazareth → Cana → Capernaum → ... → Jerusalem
- Each with unique NPCs, shops, bosses, and story
- Historically and geographically accurate
- Fast travel via "miracle teleportation"

### 4. The Content

- **50 quests**: Main story, side quests, apostle recruitment
- **25 collectible parables**: Teaching moments with gameplay bonuses
- **40 enemies**: From Skeptic Scorpions to the Seven Deadly Sins
- **13 bosses**: Each representing different obstacles to faith
- **4 miracles**: Limit breaks based on actual miracles
- **13 combo attacks**: Fish + Apostle team-up moves

### 5. The Tone

**Examples of the humor**:
- Fish names: Holy Mackerel, Bass-ic Instinct, Sole Survivor
- Bread items: Ryedemption Roll, Blessed Baguette, Unleavened Urgency
- Enemy types: Pharisee Follower, Money Changer, Doubt Incarnate
- Apostle quotes: "Upon this Bass I will build my church"

But also genuine moments:
- The weight of Judas's betrayal
- Peter's denial and redemption
- The struggle in Gethsemane
- The journey to the cross

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Is this making fun of religion?**
A: No. It's a lighthearted take on Biblical stories with genuine respect for the source material. Think LEGO games or VeggieTales—fun but reverent.

**Q: Do I need to be Christian to enjoy this?**
A: Nope! The game works on multiple levels. You can enjoy it as a JRPG with unique theming, or appreciate the deeper Biblical connections.

**Q: Will this offend people?**
A: We've been careful. Beta testers (including clergy) found it funny and respectful. If someone's offended by "Holy Mackerel," they probably weren't our audience anyway.

**Q: What about controversy?**
A: Controversy = publicity. We're not trying to be edgy, but we're not afraid of discussion either. The game speaks for itself.

**Q: Is this profitable?**
A: The market is there. Christian media is huge but often low-quality. We're offering quality. Plus, the nostalgia gaming market is booming. Combine those? Potential.

**Q: What if it fails?**
A: We've already built something cool. Worst case: we have a fun game, learned new skills, and have a great story. Best case: this becomes a franchise. Either way, worth it.

**Q: Can I contribute if I'm not religious?**
A: Absolutely. We need diverse perspectives. Respect for the material is required; personal belief is not.

**Q: What's the timeline?**
A: Flexible. This is passion-project driven, not deadline-driven. We'd rather do it right than do it fast.
