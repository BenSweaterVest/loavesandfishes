                    🐟 LOAVES AND FISHES 🍞

              "I will make you fishers of men...
                 but first, let's train some fish!"
```

## A NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER

Look, we know what you're thinking. "A Biblical fish-training JRPG? Seriously?"

Yes. Seriously.

This isn't a Christian game—it's a game that uses Biblical mythology the same way *God of War* uses Greek myths or *Hades* uses the Greek underworld. We're here to have fun, catch some absurdly powerful fish, and maybe accidentally learn something about ancient Israel along the way.

If you're religious: cool, hope you enjoy the lore! If you're atheist: also cool, hope you enjoy the fish puns! If you're just here because "Holy Mackerel" made you laugh: you're in the right place.

**Now let's go train some weapon fish.** 🐟⚔️

## THE STORY

Once upon a time, in ancient Galilee, a carpenter's son from Nazareth decided to start a ministry. Pretty standard stuff. Except in this timeline, the fish of the Sea of Galilee are *weaponized*, Jesus is basically a Pokémon trainer, and you're about to embark on the weirdest JRPG of your life.

You are **Jesus of Nazareth**, fresh out of the carpentry business and ready to change the world. Your mission: spread your message, recruit twelve extremely questionable disciples, and battle your way through ancient Israel using trained fish as weapons. Because apparently, that's a thing now.

The fish of Galilee aren't just fish—they're **weapon fish**, blessed (or cursed, depending on who you ask) with elemental powers. As you travel from town to town, you'll catch these aquatic warriors, train them up, and use them to fight everything from skeptical scorpions to the literal embodiment of the seven deadly sins.

It's a story of faith, friendship, and *holy mackerels*.

Look, we didn't say it made sense. We just said it would be fun.

## THE TWELVE APOSTLES

Your companions on this journey. They mean well. Mostly.

- **Signature Combo**: Rock Slide (with Bass of Galilee)
- **Best Used**: When you need defense and can ignore his drama

**Background**: Peter is the most enthusiastic person you've ever met, which is both inspiring and exhausting. He'll die for you, deny knowing you, and then cry about it. He's the best and worst person to have around. You love him anyway.

---

### ANDREW - *The Chill Brother*

**"We have found the Messiah!" - First follower, sets the bar pretty high**

- **Hometown**: Capernaum (Peter's significantly more stable brother)
- **Personality**: The calm one, brings people together, wishes his brother would relax
- **Battle Ability**: **Fisher of Men**
  - Pulls an additional enemy into battle (why would you want this?)

- **Signature Combo**: Net of Faith (with Tilapia Sanctus)
- **Best Used**: When you want to level up fast and don't mind the chaos

**Background**: Andrew is the first disciple but somehow the least dramatic, which is saying something in this group. He's always introducing people to you and then quietly exiting before the chaos starts.

---

### JAMES (son of Zebedee) - *Son of Thunder (Literal)*

**"Can we call down fire from heaven on this village?" - NO, JAMES**

**Background**: James has two settings: passionate and ON FIRE. He and his brother are called "Sons of Thunder" because they're about as subtle as a lightning strike. He's loyal, brave, and will absolutely suggest burning down a village if they're rude to you.

---

### JOHN - *The Favorite (Don't Tell the Others)*

**"The disciple whom Jesus loved" - Way to make it weird, John**

- **Best Used**: Against bosses when you need big damage

**Background**: The youngest apostle and the one who actually listens during the parables. John sees deeper meanings in everything, which is either profound or overthinking, depending on the day. He's the one who writes everything down and makes everyone else feel bad about their memory.

---

### BARTHOLOMEW (Nathanael) - *The Honest One (Too Honest)*

**"Here is a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit!" - So, he's blunt. Got it.**

  - Reveals enemy buffs (no secrets allowed)
- **Signature Combo**: Fig Tree Judgment (with Prophet Perch)
- **Best Used**: When your party is afflicted and you need clarity

**Background**: "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" was Nathanael's opening line to you. He speaks his mind with zero filter, which is refreshing until he tells you your sermon was "a bit long." Once convinced, though, he's all in.

  - Doubles money earned (put those skills to good use)
- **Signature Combo**: Tax Evasion (with Carp of Capernaum)

  - 150 damage, ignores defense (doubt cuts through everything)
  - "I will not believe unless I see!"
- **Signature Combo**: Proof of Faith (with Disciple's Delight)

**Background**: Thomas wants evidence, and honestly, that's fair. He's not afraid to say "I don't buy it," which makes him annoying but also thorough. When he finally believes something, though, it's unshakeable. He's the "trust but verify" guy.

---

### JAMES (son of Alphaeus) - *The Other James*

**"The quiet strength" - He's fine with not being the main character**

- **Hometown**: Galilee (the background James)
- **Personality**: Humble, supportive, content to not be in the spotlight
- **Battle Ability**: **Humble Service**
  - Gradually restores HP over 5 turns (slow and steady)
- **Signature Combo**: Silent Strength (with Humble Herring)
- **Best Used**: For sustained battles where you need healing over time

- **Battle Ability**: **Zealous Fury**
  - 180 damage to all enemies
  - User takes recoil (rage has consequences)
- **Signature Combo**: Revolutionary Wave (with Justice Grouper)
- **Best Used**: When you need AOE and can heal the recoil

**Background**: Simon was a Zealot, which meant he wanted to overthrow Rome with violence. Now he's redirected that energy into... fish battles? It's character growth, kind of. He's passionate, intense, and has strong opinions about everything.

---

### JUDAS ISCARIOT - *The Betrayer (Yeah, THAT One)*

**"Surely you don't mean me, Rabbi?" - Narrator: He did mean him**

- **Hometown**: Kerioth, Judea (the only non-Galilean, which tracks)

- **Battle Ability**: **Silver Pieces**
  - Sacrifice a fish to gain massive денarii
  - "Everything has its price..." (ominous)
- **Signature Combo**: Thirty Pieces (with Leviathan)

**WARNING**: Using Judas's ability too much affects the story. You've been warned.

---

## THE SACRED FISH

The fish of the Sea of Galilee have been blessed with mysterious powers. Or cursed. Honestly, it's unclear. Either way, they fight now.

## THE FIVE ELEMENTS

Type effectiveness chart! For fish! We made a whole system!

### TYPE EFFECTIVENESS CHART

```
              DEFENDING TYPE
         Holy  Water  Earth  Spirit Dark
      ┌─────────────────────────────────
HOLY  │  1x    1.5x   1x     1.5x   2x
WATER │  1x    0.5x   1.5x   1x     1x
EARTH │  1x    0.5x   1x     1x     1.5x
SPIRIT│ 0.5x   1x     1x     1x     1.5x
DARK  │ 2x     1x     0.5x   0.5x   0.5x
```

**Reading the Chart** (For people who didn't play Pokémon):
- **2x** = Super Effective (CRITICAL HIT energy)
- **1.5x** = Effective (pretty good)
- **1x** = Normal damage (meh)
- **0.5x** = Not very effective (why are you doing this)

### ELEMENTAL PHILOSOPHY

**HOLY** - *The Light*
- Represents: Faith, hope, divine wrath
- Strength: Obliterates darkness
- Weakness: Darkness corrupts light
- Vibe: Paladin energy

**WATER** - *The Flow*
- Represents: Life, cleansing, going with it
- Strength: Erosion wins eventually
- Weakness: Can be dispersed
- Vibe: "I'm very chill" (lies, is 90% of the ocean)

**EARTH** - *The Foundation*
- Represents: Stability, stubbornness, rocks
- Strength: Immovable object
- Weakness: Slow, inflexible
- Vibe: Tank build

**SPIRIT** - *The Unseen*
- Represents: Mystery, the eternal, spooky stuff
- Strength: Can't hit what you can't see
- Weakness: Requires faith to use effectively
- Vibe: Ghost type but make it theological

**DARK** - *The Shadow*
- Represents: Doubt, temptation, edge
- Strength: Knows all your weaknesses (personal)
- Weakness: Light still wins
- Vibe: Emo phase in fish form
