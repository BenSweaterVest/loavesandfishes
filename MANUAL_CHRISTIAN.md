## THE STORY

In ancient times, when the Roman Empire stretched across the known world, a carpenter's son from Nazareth embarked on a journey that would change history forever. But this is not merely a retelling of ancient scripture—this is YOUR story, where faith meets adventure in ways never imagined.

You are **Jesus of Nazareth**, beginning your ministry in the Galilee region. Your mission: to spread the word, perform miracles, and gather twelve disciples who will help you on your journey. But in this world, the journey takes an unexpected turn...

The fish of the Sea of Galilee have been blessed with mysterious powers. These aren't ordinary fish—they're **weapon fish**, creatures imbued with elemental energies that reflect the spiritual battle between light and darkness. As you travel through ancient Israel, you'll collect these sacred fish, train them in battle, and use them to overcome the forces of evil that seek to stop your ministry.

It's a story of faith, friendship, and holy mackerels.
